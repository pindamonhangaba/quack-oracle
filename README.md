# oracle_scanner

A DuckDB extension that reads and writes **Oracle Database** directly.

No Oracle Instant Client, no OCI, no ODPI-C, no ODBC, no JDBC, no Python, no
helper process. It speaks Oracle's own network protocol (TNS/TTC) itself, so
installing it is copying one file — there is nothing else to set up.

```sql
CREATE SECRET ora (TYPE oracle, HOST 'db.example.com', PORT 1521,
                   SERVICE_NAME 'ORCLPDB1', USER 'scott', PASSWORD '...');

SELECT * FROM oracle_query('ora', 'SELECT id, label FROM app.items');
```

> **Status:** version 0.2.0, published to DuckDB Community Extensions — one
> `INSTALL` and you are done, see [Install](#1-install). Reads, writes,
> procedure calls and TLS are verified against live Oracle 19c, Oracle Free
> 23ai, and OCI Autonomous Database.

## If you know Oracle but not DuckDB

Most people who need this extension arrive from the Oracle side, so here is the
part that is usually assumed.

**DuckDB is not a server.** There is no listener, no instance to start, no
tnsnames on its side, nothing to administer. It is a library that runs inside
whatever process opened it — think SQLite, but columnar and built for analytical
SQL. You open it, you query, you close it. A database can even live entirely in
memory and leave nothing behind.

**An extension is a plugin for it.** `oracle_scanner` is a single file that
DuckDB loads at runtime, after which DuckDB itself speaks Oracle's TNS/TTC
protocol. Nothing else is installed on the machine, and nothing is installed on
your Oracle server — from the database's point of view, another client
connected.

**Why put it between you and Oracle at all?** Because once Oracle is one source
among many, joining `APP.ORDERS` to a Parquet file, a CSV export, or a
PostgreSQL table is one `SELECT`, and moving rows between them is one `INSERT`.
That is what a small analytical engine buys you here — not faster access to
Oracle alone.

Terms you will meet below, in Oracle terms:

| In DuckDB | The closest thing you already know |
| --- | --- |
| `duckdb` shell | `sqlplus` / SQLcl — the client you type SQL into |
| secret | stored credentials for a connection; the Oracle equivalent of what you keep in a wallet or a connect string |
| `TNS_ALIAS` in a secret | an alias from `tnsnames.ora` — the extension reads it out of the wallet ZIP itself |
| table function (`oracle_query(...)`) | a pipelined table function: something you `SELECT` *from* |
| `ATTACH` | closest to a database link, but pointing the other way: DuckDB mounts your Oracle schema, not the reverse |
| catalog | one attached database; its schema and tables keep their Oracle names |
| filter pushdown | predicate sent to Oracle instead of being evaluated after the fetch |
| vector / chunk | a batch of rows, like `arraysize` in SQL\*Plus, but columnar |

**What this does not replace.** Data Pump and GoldenGate — this is not export,
import, or replication. `ora2pg` — that converts schemas and PL/SQL, this moves
data. A database link inside Oracle — that lets Oracle reach out, this lets you
reach in without installing anything on the server. RMAN — no backup here of any
kind.

## 1. Install

The extension is in DuckDB Community Extensions, so installing it is two
statements:

```sql
INSTALL oracle_scanner FROM community;
LOAD oracle_scanner;
```

A signed binary for your platform is downloaded once and stays installed; no
`-unsigned` flag, no build, and nothing from an Oracle client comes with it.
Version 0.2.0 targets **DuckDB v1.5.5**, which is the DuckDB version that will
load it.

Prefer to build from source — to hack on it, or to run against a DuckDB you
built yourself? That path still works:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/krokozyab/quack-oracle.git
cd quack-oracle
make release
./build/release/duckdb -unsigned
```

You need a C++17 compiler, CMake, and OpenSSL. The first build compiles DuckDB
itself and takes twenty to forty minutes; later builds are much faster. A
locally built extension is unsigned, so loading it into another DuckDB needs
`duckdb -unsigned` (or the `allow_unsigned_extensions` setting in a client
library) and the file at
`build/release/extension/oracle_scanner/oracle_scanner.duckdb_extension`.

Check that it worked:

```sql
SELECT extension_name, loaded FROM duckdb_extensions()
WHERE extension_name = 'oracle_scanner';
```

No Oracle to point at yet? [§13](#13-try-it-yourself) starts a free one in a
container, creates a small demo schema, and walks every feature against it.

---

## 2. Connect to a database

A connection is stored as a DuckDB **secret**. You create it once per session
and then refer to it by name. There is no connection string and no
`tnsnames.ora` on disk to configure.

### The usual case

```sql
CREATE SECRET ora (
    TYPE oracle,
    HOST 'db.example.com',
    PORT 1521,
    SERVICE_NAME 'ORCLPDB1',
    USER 'scott',
    PASSWORD 'tiger'
);
```

`ora` is just a name you pick; every function below takes it as its first
argument. Make several secrets if you use several databases.

### Oracle Autonomous Database, or anything with a wallet

Cloud Oracle hands you a wallet ZIP. Point at the ZIP and name the alias from
the `tnsnames.ora` inside it — the ZIP is read in memory and never unpacked to
disk:

```sql
CREATE SECRET ora_cloud (
    TYPE oracle,
    TNS_ALIAS 'mydb_low',
    USER 'ADMIN',
    PASSWORD '...',
    PROTOCOL 'tcps',
    TLS_SERVER_NAME 'adb.<your-region>.oraclecloud.com',
    WALLET_FILE '/secure/Wallet_mydb.zip'
);
```

The wallet ZIP needs no password: its `cwallet.sso` is an auto-login store, the
same one SQL\*Plus and JDBC open. Add `WALLET_PASSWORD` only for a bare
`ewallet.pem` whose key is encrypted.

### Encrypted connection without a wallet

```sql
CREATE SECRET ora_tls (
    TYPE oracle, HOST 'db.example.com', PORT 2484, SERVICE_NAME 'service',
    USER 'app_user', PASSWORD '...', PROTOCOL 'tcps',
    TLS_SERVER_NAME 'db.example.com', TLS_CA_FILE '/secure/ca.pem'
);
```

### All the fields

| Field | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `HOST`, `PORT`, `SERVICE_NAME` | The database endpoint |
| `USER`, `PASSWORD` | Your Oracle credentials |
| `PROTOCOL` | `tcp` (the default) or `tcps` for TLS |
| `TNS_ALIAS` | An alias from the `tnsnames.ora` inside the wallet ZIP — use *instead of* HOST/PORT/SERVICE_NAME |
| `WALLET_FILE` | A cloud wallet ZIP, an `ewallet.pem` bundle, or an auto-login `cwallet.sso` |
| `WALLET_PASSWORD` | The password the wallet's encrypted `ewallet.pem` is locked with. Not needed when the wallet carries `cwallet.sso` — every wallet OCI hands out does |
| `TLS_SERVER_NAME` | The name checked against the server certificate |
| `TLS_SNI_NAME` | Only when the endpoint is an IP or a different virtual host |
| `TLS_CA_FILE` | An explicit PEM trust list; system roots are then not used |
| `TLS_SERVER_CERT_DN` | Require this exact certificate subject, in addition to the hostname |
| `DISABLE_OOB` | Disable Oracle Net's TCP urgent-byte capability and connection-time OOB probe. Defaults to `false` |
| `CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, `READ_TIMEOUT` | Socket timeouts in seconds |

**A service name, not a SID.** The connect descriptor this client builds always
uses `(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=...))`; there is no `SID` field. On an older
non-CDB instance where you are used to connecting by SID, ask the database for a
service name it also answers to:

```sql
SELECT value FROM v$parameter WHERE name = 'service_names';
```

or read them off the listener with `lsnrctl services`. Every supported Oracle
version registers at least one service name, so this is a lookup, not a
migration.

**Certificate and hostname verification are always on and cannot be turned
off.** That is deliberate: there is no insecure mode to fall back to. TLS
fields combined with plain `tcp` are rejected rather than quietly ignored, so a
typo cannot downgrade your connection.

---

## 3. Read data

`oracle_query` runs a `SELECT` on Oracle and streams the rows into DuckDB:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_query('ora', 'SELECT id, label FROM app.items');
```

Rows stream as they arrive, so `LIMIT` is fast and a table far bigger than
memory is fine.

Join Oracle data with anything else DuckDB can read:

```sql
SELECT i.label, s.total
FROM oracle_query('ora', 'SELECT id, label FROM app.items') AS i
JOIN read_csv('sales.csv') AS s ON s.item_id = i.id;
```

### Passing values safely (bind parameters)

Never paste values into the SQL text. Pass them as a third argument instead —
Oracle then treats them as data, not as SQL.

**Named placeholders** use a `STRUCT`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_query(
    'ora', 'SELECT * FROM app.items WHERE label = :label AND id > :low',
    {'label': 'widget', 'low': 100});
```

**Numbered placeholders** use a `LIST`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_query(
    'ora', 'SELECT * FROM app.items WHERE id BETWEEN :1 AND :2',
    [10, 20]);
```

⚠️ **One catch worth knowing.** A DuckDB `LIST` can only hold one type, so
`[1, 'one', DATE '2026-01-02']` will not even build. When your values have
different types, use a `STRUCT` whose keys are `'1'`, `'2'`, … — it fills
numbered placeholders and accepts any mix:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_execute(
    'ora', 'INSERT INTO app.items VALUES (:1, :2, :3)',
    {'1': 1, '2': 'one', '3': DATE '2026-01-02'});
```

---

## 4. Use a whole Oracle schema (`ATTACH`)

Instead of writing Oracle SQL by hand, mount the schema and use plain DuckDB
SQL against it:

```sql
ATTACH 'ora' AS o (TYPE oracle_scanner);

SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM o.ITEMS WHERE id > 100;
SELECT count(*) FROM o.ORDERS;
```

The thing in quotes is the **secret name**, not a connection string.

You get the tables and views of the user you connected as — the same set
`USER_TABLES` and `USER_VIEWS` would give you, resolved lazily as you name them
rather than all at once. Names come back as Oracle stores them, which is upper
case unless they were created quoted — so `o.ITEMS`, not `o.items`. `DESCRIBE`
works, and `NOT NULL` columns and primary keys show up in
`duckdb_constraints()`.

The dictionary queries you would reach for have local equivalents here, so you
can stay in one SQL dialect:

| Instead of | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `SELECT table_name FROM user_tables` | `SHOW ALL TABLES` |
| `DESC APP.ITEMS` | `DESCRIBE o.ITEMS` |
| `SELECT * FROM user_tab_columns` | `SELECT * FROM duckdb_columns()` |
| `SELECT * FROM user_constraints` | `SELECT * FROM duckdb_constraints()` |
| `SELECT * FROM all_arguments` | `SELECT * FROM oracle_arguments('ora', 'APP.PROC')` |

You can also `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` here — see the next section.

**What `ATTACH` will not do:** create or drop tables, create schemas, or reach
another user's schema. This extension issues no DDL at all. For those, use
`oracle_query` with a fully qualified name, or see
[the DDL note](#i-need-to-run-create-table-or-another-ddl-statement).

### Pushing filters down to Oracle

By default DuckDB fetches the rows and filters them itself. To have Oracle do
the filtering:

```sql
SET oracle_filter_pushdown = true;
```

It is off by default on purpose. Once DuckDB hands a filter to the scan it
removes it from its own plan, so the scan has to apply it *exactly* — and this
extension refuses any filter whose Oracle meaning it cannot prove identical.
With pushdown on, such a filter raises an error instead of just being slower.

Pushed down: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, `IN`
(up to 1,000 values), and `AND`/`OR` of those, on number, date and timestamp
columns. Text comparisons are mostly refused because Oracle's collation and its
blank-padded `CHAR` comparison depend on session settings this client does not
negotiate.

---

## 5. Write data

### Through an attached schema — with real transactions

```sql
ATTACH 'ora' AS o (TYPE oracle_scanner);

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO o.ITEMS VALUES (7, 'seven');
UPDATE o.ITEMS SET label = 'VII' WHERE id = 7;
SELECT count(*) FROM o.ITEMS;   -- sees the rows you just wrote
COMMIT;                         -- or ROLLBACK, and Oracle rolls back too
```

DuckDB's `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` mean exactly what they say in Oracle: one
Oracle session is pinned to the transaction. A query inside the transaction
reads through that same session, so it sees your own uncommitted rows — which
no other session can see.

`INSERT ... RETURNING` works and asks Oracle for the row it actually stored, so
identity values, `DEFAULT`s and trigger results come back:

```sql
INSERT INTO o.ITEMS (label) VALUES ('eight') RETURNING id, label;
```

Columns you do not name are left out of the statement, so Oracle's own
`DEFAULT` still applies. `UPDATE` and `DELETE` find rows by Oracle's ROWID, so
the table does not need a primary key. (`RETURNING` on `UPDATE`/`DELETE` is not
supported yet.)

### One statement at a time

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_execute('ora',
    'UPDATE app.items SET label = :1 WHERE id = :2', ['x', 7]);
```

Returns `affected_rows`. Accepts `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` only.

### Many rows at once

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_execute_many('ora',
    'INSERT INTO app.items (id, label) VALUES (:id, :label)',
    [{'id': 1, 'label': 'one'}, {'id': 2, 'label': 'two'}]);
```

This is much faster than a loop: the rows go as Oracle array DML — one parse,
one round trip for up to 1,024 rows. If a row fails, the error tells you which
row it was, counted from the start of your batch.

> `oracle_execute` and `oracle_execute_many` commit in Oracle by themselves, so
> they **refuse to run inside `BEGIN TRANSACTION`**. If you need transactional
> writes, use the attached-schema form above.

---

## 6. Call procedures and functions

### Start by asking what the arguments are

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_arguments('ora', 'APP.CALCULATE_TOTAL');
```

One row per argument: its name, position, direction (`IN`/`OUT`/`IN OUT`),
Oracle type — and, if this version cannot pass that type, the reason. Position 0
is a function's return value. Names reached through a synonym are resolved.

### The easy way

`oracle_call_auto` reads that signature for you, so you only supply values — a
list of text, one per argument in declaration order, with `NULL` in each `OUT`
slot:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_call_auto('ora', 'APP.CALCULATE_TOTAL', ['42', NULL]);
```

You get back `(name, value, cursor_handle)` rows, with a function's return
value first, named `return_value`.

### The explicit way

When you want to state the shape yourself, use `oracle_call_named` (or
`oracle_call_named_function`) with one struct per argument:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_call_named('ora', 'APP.CALCULATE_TOTAL',
    [{'name': 'p_id',    'direction': 'in',  'type': 'number',  'value': '42'},
     {'name': 'p_total', 'direction': 'out', 'type': 'number',  'value': NULL}]);
```

Types are `number`, `varchar`, `date`, `timestamp`, `raw` (uppercase hex),
`float`, `double`, and `cursor`.

### Getting a result set back

A procedure or function that returns a `SYS_REFCURSOR` gives you a handle
instead of a value. Read it once with `oracle_cursor`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_call_auto('ora', 'APP.LIST_ITEMS', [NULL]);
-- cursor_handle → 'oracle:...'
SELECT * FROM oracle_cursor('oracle:...');
```

Handles belong to your DuckDB connection and are consumed once. Release one you
decide not to read with `oracle_close_call`.

---

## 7. Read a big table faster

A normal scan is one Oracle session on one thread. For a large table, split it
across several sessions by a numeric key:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_scan_parallel('ora', 'BIG_TABLE', 'ID', shards := 8);
```

Every shard reads the table `AS OF SCN` at one change number taken before any
of them start, so you get **one consistent snapshot**, not several moments
stitched together. If the database will not give out a change number, the scan
is refused rather than run unpinned.

Requirements: the key column must be `NUMBER` with whole-number values (a
boundary computed by rounding could fall between two keys). Rows with a NULL key
get a shard of their own, so nothing is skipped. `shards` defaults to your
DuckDB thread count.

You also need `EXECUTE` on `SYS.DBMS_FLASHBACK` and `FLASHBACK` on the table.

---

## 8. Settings

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oracle_session_pool_size` | `4` | How many authenticated Oracle sessions to keep and reuse for reads, per DuckDB connection per secret. `0` opens a fresh one every time. |
| `oracle_filter_pushdown` | `false` | Send `WHERE` clauses on attached tables to Oracle. See [section 4](#pushing-filters-down-to-oracle). |

Pooling matters more than it looks. Opening a session costs a TCP connect, a TLS
handshake and an authentication round trip: against a cloud endpoint that was
**1.57 s per statement**, against **0.18 s** when reusing one.

---

## 9. Which Oracle types work

| Oracle | Comes back as | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NUMBER(p,0)`, p ≤ 18 | `BIGINT` | |
| `NUMBER(p,s)` | `DECIMAL(p,s)` | up to p = 38 |
| `NUMBER` (unconstrained) | `VARCHAR` | exact only as text |
| `VARCHAR2`, `CHAR` | `VARCHAR` | |
| `DATE` | `TIMESTAMP` | an Oracle `DATE` carries a time, so it is not a DuckDB `DATE` |
| `TIMESTAMP(0–6)` | `TIMESTAMP` | |
| `TIMESTAMP(7–9)` | `TIMESTAMP_NS` | |
| `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` | `VARCHAR` | keeps its offset, which `TIMESTAMPTZ` would drop |
| `RAW` | `BLOB` | |
| `BINARY_FLOAT`, `BINARY_DOUBLE` | `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE` | |
| `CLOB`, `NCLOB` | `VARCHAR` | see the warning below |
| `BLOB` | `BLOB` | see the warning below |

Anything else — `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR2`, `INTERVAL`, `TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME
ZONE`, `BFILE`, object and collection types — is **refused when the query is
bound**, with a message naming the column and the reason. It is never decoded
into something that looks right and is not.

The connection supports Oracle database character set IDs `873` (`AL32UTF8`)
and `31` (`WE8ISO8859P1`). It advertises `AL32UTF8` as the client encoding, so
ordinary character values, SQL text, and binds are exposed as UTF-8. A Latin-1
database still cannot store every Unicode character; writes outside its
repertoire retain Oracle's server-side behavior rather than receiving a client
replacement policy. CLOB decoding follows the locator's encoding flags, while
NCLOB is decoded as UTF-16BE.

### Why your table came back as all text

A column declared plain `NUMBER`, with no precision or scale, is the third row
of that table: it arrives as `VARCHAR`. On a schema where most columns are
declared that way — which is usual for anything generated by an ETL tool or an
integration platform — the result is a table with no numeric column at all, and
`SUM` or a join on a numeric key will not work until you say what the type is.

That is deliberate, and the reason is that Oracle's `NUMBER` is a base-100
decimal with up to 38 significant digits. Nothing in DuckDB holds every such
value: `DOUBLE` loses digits (summing 200,000 invoice amounts drifts by about
two cents), and any fixed `DECIMAL(38,s)` has to pick an `s` and silently round
whatever has more. Text is the only form that is always exact, so an
unconstrained `NUMBER` is handed over intact and you choose the type you want:

```sql
SELECT
    CAST(TRX_ID       AS BIGINT)         AS trx_id,
    CAST(UNIT_WEIGHT  AS DECIMAL(38,6))  AS unit_weight,   -- exact to 6 places
    CAST(UNIT_VOLUME  AS DOUBLE)         AS unit_volume    -- fine for ratios
FROM atp.main.ITEMS;
```

Two practical notes. `CAST(... AS DECIMAL(p,s))` is what you want for money and
for anything you will reconcile — it is exact within the scale you name, and it
errors rather than rounds if a value does not fit. And if the table is yours,
declaring the column as `NUMBER(p)` or `NUMBER(p,s)` in Oracle is better than
casting on every read: the extension then maps it to `BIGINT` or `DECIMAL`
directly, and every client that touches the table gets a real numeric type.

⚠️ **LOB columns are expensive.** A `CLOB`/`BLOB` value is not in the row; the
row carries only a pointer, and fetching the content costs extra round trips per
value. Measured: 2,000 rows with a 2,000-character CLOB took **1.22 s**, against
**0.004 s** for the same rows without that column. Select a LOB column only when
you need it. Writing a LOB is not supported.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

### `The file was built specifically for DuckDB version 'v1.5.5'`

Your DuckDB is a different version. Install DuckDB v1.5.5 and run
`INSTALL oracle_scanner FROM community` again, or, if you built from source,
use the shell this project produced (`./build/release/duckdb`).

### DuckDB refuses the extension as unsigned

A locally built extension carries no DuckDB signature. Start the shell with
`-unsigned`, or set `allow_unsigned_extensions` in your client library.

### `Oracle SQL statement terminators are not accepted`

Remove the `;` from the end of the SQL string you passed. The string is one
statement, not a script.

### `oracle_query accepts only SELECT or WITH queries`

`oracle_query` reads. Use `oracle_execute` for `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`.

### `oracle_execute accepts only INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE`

<a id="i-need-to-run-create-table-or-another-ddl-statement"></a>
You are trying to run DDL. This extension issues no DDL, but you can ask Oracle
to do it through a standard Oracle procedure:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_call_auto('ora', 'DBMS_UTILITY.EXEC_DDL_STATEMENT',
    ['CREATE TABLE t (id NUMBER(10), label VARCHAR2(50))']);
```

The same route runs anything that is a single procedure call. Anonymous PL/SQL
blocks (`BEGIN ... END;`) cannot be run at all.

### `oracle_execute cannot run inside an explicit DuckDB transaction`

`oracle_execute` commits in Oracle on its own, which a DuckDB `ROLLBACK` could
not undo. Either drop the `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, or write through an attached
schema instead ([section 5](#5-write-data)).

### `oracle_query params must be a LIST or STRUCT`

Bind values go in **one** third argument, not as extra arguments:
`oracle_query('ora', 'SELECT :1 FROM dual', ['x'])`.

### `Could not convert string 'one' to INT32`

Your `LIST` mixes types, and a DuckDB list only holds one. Use a `STRUCT` keyed
`'1'`, `'2'`, … instead — see [section 3](#passing-values-safely-bind-parameters).

### `Oracle column "X" cannot be read: ...`

That column's type is not supported. List the columns you need instead of
`SELECT *`; the rest of the table still works.

### `ORA-01466: unable to read data`

`oracle_scan_parallel` takes a consistent snapshot, and the table was created or
altered too recently to read as of an earlier moment. Wait a few minutes, or use
a plain `oracle_query`.

### `ORA-28000: the account is locked`

Too many failed logins locked the Oracle account. Ask a DBA to unlock it — and
check for a stale password in an old secret.

### `OpenSSL could not decrypt the client private key in wallet PEM`

You set `WALLET_PASSWORD` and it is not the password that `ewallet.pem` was
encrypted with — it is the one you chose when downloading the wallet, not the
database (ADMIN) password.

If you no longer have it, drop `WALLET_PASSWORD` entirely: the extension then
opens the wallet's `cwallet.sso` instead, which is the auto-login store SQL\*Plus,
SQLcl and JDBC use, and it needs no password at all. That works for every wallet
OCI hands out. The one wallet it cannot open is an *auto-login local* store,
which is tied to the machine and account that created it; that case is refused
by name.

---

## 11. Build and test from source

```sh
make debug                    # builds DuckDB + the extension with sanitizers
make test_debug               # the SQL test suite
ctest --test-dir build/debug/extension/oracle_scanner --output-on-failure
```

`ctest` runs both C++ suites: `oracle_scanner_protocol_test` for the protocol
and codec layers, and `oracle_scanner_adapter_test`, which drives the DuckDB
adapter against a fake Oracle session and so needs no database, network, or
credentials.

For a fast protocol-only check that does not build DuckDB at all — seconds
rather than tens of minutes:

```sh
scripts/build_protocol_test.sh
```

It derives its source list from the `oracle_scanner_protocol_test` target in
`CMakeLists.txt`, builds this project's sources with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`,
and runs the result. OpenSSL comes from vcpkg in Community builds and may come
from the system locally.

`scripts/run_live_stages.sh` runs every live wire stage against one endpoint;
`scripts/check_no_oracle_client.sh` proves a built extension links and imports
nothing from an Oracle client, and fails rather than reporting success if it
cannot inspect the binary.

- **[docs/CAPABILITIES.md](docs/CAPABILITIES.md)** — the precise support
  boundary: every type, every refusal and its reason, what `ATTACH` can and
  cannot do, and the full list of what is not supported. Read this before
  planning a migration around the extension.
- **[docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md)** — where the version lives and what

  — a worked write-up of the whole pattern: the load as one statement, sharding
  the read across sessions under one snapshot, and reconciling both databases
  without dragging the tables across the network.

Guarantees that hold by construction: no Oracle client is linked or loaded (CI
checks the shipped binary on every build); no password, wallet password, key or
bind value is ever logged or persisted; wallet ZIPs are read in memory and never
written to disk; and TLS verification has no off switch.

Never commit database credentials, wallets, production descriptors, or raw
captures to this repository.

## 13. Try it yourself

Everything below runs against a demo schema this repository ships, so you can
follow it end to end without touching a real database. It takes about five
minutes: get an Oracle, create six demo objects, then walk every feature.

Each example shows what it actually prints — the output here was captured from
a real run, not written by hand.

### 13.1 Get an Oracle to point at

**A container, free and local.** `gvenzl/oracle-free` needs no Oracle account:

```sh
docker run -d --name oracle-demo -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=demo_password \
    gvenzl/oracle-free:slim
docker logs -f oracle-demo   # wait for "DATABASE IS READY TO USE!"
```

That gives you service `FREEPDB1` on port 1521, user `system`. Oracle's own
`container-registry.oracle.com/database/free` works the same way, and a 19c
image built from [Oracle's docker-images](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images)
serves `ORCLPDB1` instead.

**Oracle Autonomous Database, free forever.** Create an Always Free ADB in the
OCI console, then **Database connection → Download wallet**. You get a
`Wallet_<name>.zip`; keep it somewhere private. Its `tnsnames.ora` holds aliases
like `<name>_low`, `<name>_medium`, `<name>_high` — you connect by alias, and the
extension reads the wallet out of the ZIP in memory. Nothing is unpacked to disk.

### 13.2 Create the demo schema

[`examples/demo_setup.sql`](examples/demo_setup.sql) creates six objects and is
safe to re-run — it drops its own tables first. It works unchanged on 19c, 23ai
Free and Autonomous, in whatever schema you connect as.

| Object | What it is there for |
| --- | --- |
| `QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS` | 4 rows to scan, filter and read in parallel. `LOCATION` and `HEADCOUNT` are NULL in one row on purpose. |
| `QUACK_DEMO_LOG` | An IDENTITY key and a `DEFAULT SYSDATE`, to write to. |
| `QUACK_DEMO_TYPES` | One row holding one column of every type in [§9](#9-which-oracle-types-work). |
| `QUACK_DEMO_ADD` | A function, for a return value. |
| `QUACK_DEMO_GREET` | A procedure with an `OUT` argument. |
| `QUACK_DEMO_LIST` | A procedure returning a `SYS_REFCURSOR`. |

In a container:

```sh
docker cp examples/demo_setup.sql oracle-demo:/tmp/
docker exec -i oracle-demo bash -c \
    'sqlplus -s system/$ORACLE_PASSWORD@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1 @/tmp/demo_setup.sql'
```

On Autonomous, the easiest route is **Database Actions → SQL** in the OCI
console: paste the file and run it. With a local SQL\*Plus and the wallet
unpacked into `$TNS_ADMIN`, `sqlplus admin/<password>@<name>_low @examples/demo_setup.sql`
does the same.

Either way it ends by listing what it made:

```
QUACK_DEMO_ADD          FUNCTION    VALID
QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS  TABLE       VALID
QUACK_DEMO_GREET        PROCEDURE   VALID
QUACK_DEMO_LIST         PROCEDURE   VALID
QUACK_DEMO_LOG          TABLE       VALID
QUACK_DEMO_TYPES        TABLE       VALID
```

### 13.3 Connect

Start DuckDB with the extension loaded ([§1](#1-install)), then create a secret.
Against the container:

```sql
CREATE SECRET demo (
    TYPE oracle, HOST '127.0.0.1', PORT 1521,
    SERVICE_NAME 'FREEPDB1', USER 'system', PASSWORD 'demo_password'
);
```

Against Autonomous — alias instead of host, and the wallet ZIP exactly as you
downloaded it:

```sql
CREATE SECRET demo (
    TYPE oracle,
    TNS_ALIAS 'mydb_low',
    USER 'ADMIN', PASSWORD '<your ADMIN password>',
    WALLET_FILE '/secure/Wallet_mydb.zip'
);
```

The alias carries the host, port, service and TLS settings, so those fields must
not be repeated — the extension rejects the combination rather than guessing
which wins.

No wallet password appears there, and none is needed: the extension opens the
wallet's `cwallet.sso`, the auto-login store SQL\*Plus, SQLcl and JDBC use, whose
key is unlocked by the file itself. Nothing is unpacked to disk — the ZIP is read
in memory and the identity goes straight into the TLS context.

`WALLET_PASSWORD` remains for the other case: a wallet you hold as a bare
`ewallet.pem`, whose private key is encrypted. It is the password you chose when
downloading the wallet, never the ADMIN password. Supply it and `ewallet.pem` is
used instead of the auto-login store:

```sql
CREATE SECRET demo_pem (
    TYPE oracle,
    TNS_ALIAS 'mydb_low',
    USER 'ADMIN', PASSWORD '<your ADMIN password>',
    WALLET_FILE '/secure/Wallet_mydb.zip',
    WALLET_PASSWORD '<the wallet password, not the ADMIN password>'
);
```

If that password is wrong, the error is:

> OpenSSL could not decrypt the client private key in wallet PEM

Check the connection, and that the password is not readable back:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_query('demo', 'SELECT user FROM DUAL');
SELECT name, type, secret_string FROM duckdb_secrets();
```
```
┌─────────┐    name=demo;type=oracle;provider=config;serializable=true;scope;
│  USER   │    host=127.0.0.1;password=redacted;port=1521;
│ SYSTEM  │    service_name=FREEPDB1;user=system
└─────────┘
```

### 13.4 Read

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_query('demo',
    'SELECT department_id, department_name FROM quack_demo_departments ORDER BY 1');
```
```
┌───────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ DEPARTMENT_ID │ DEPARTMENT_NAME │
├───────────────┼─────────────────┤
│            10 │ ACCOUNTING      │
│            20 │ RESEARCH        │
│            30 │ SALES           │
│            40 │ OPERATIONS      │
└───────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

Never paste values into the SQL — bind them, by name or by position:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_query('demo',
    'SELECT * FROM quack_demo_departments WHERE headcount > :min', {'min': 20});

SELECT * FROM oracle_query('demo',
    'SELECT * FROM quack_demo_departments WHERE department_id BETWEEN :1 AND :2', [10, 30]);
```

### 13.5 Mount the whole schema

```sql
ATTACH 'demo' AS ora (TYPE oracle_scanner);
SHOW ALL TABLES;
SELECT * FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS WHERE HEADCOUNT > 20;
```

Nothing is read from Oracle's dictionary until you ask for it: `ATTACH` costs a
single round trip, a table's columns are fetched when the table is first named,
and the whole schema's column metadata arrives in one query rather than one per
table.

The types come back as [§9](#9-which-oracle-types-work) promises — this is what
`QUACK_DEMO_TYPES` is for:

```sql
DESCRIBE ora.QUACK_DEMO_TYPES;
```
```
N_INT      bigint        -- NUMBER(5,0)
N_DECIMAL  decimal(10,5) -- NUMBER(10,5)
N_ANY      varchar       -- unconstrained NUMBER: exact only as text
V, C       varchar       -- VARCHAR2, CHAR
D          timestamp     -- an Oracle DATE carries a time
TS         timestamp     -- TIMESTAMP(6)
TS_NS      timestamp_ns  -- TIMESTAMP(9)
TS_TZ      varchar       -- keeps the offset TIMESTAMPTZ would drop
R          blob          -- RAW
BF, BD     float, double -- BINARY_FLOAT, BINARY_DOUBLE
```

### 13.6 Push the filtering into Oracle

```sql
SET oracle_filter_pushdown = true;

SELECT DEPARTMENT_NAME, HEADCOUNT FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS WHERE HEADCOUNT > 20;
SELECT DEPARTMENT_NAME FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS WHERE LOCATION IS NULL;
SELECT DEPARTMENT_NAME FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID IN (10, 30);
SELECT DEPARTMENT_NAME FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS WHERE DEPARTMENT_NAME = 'SALES';
SELECT D FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_TYPES WHERE D = TIMESTAMP '2024-03-01 00:00:00';
```

All five are sent to Oracle. These three are refused, by name, instead of being
approximated — and the message tells you how to turn pushdown off:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS WHERE DEPARTMENT_NAME > 'A';
-- ordered comparison on a column that is not NUMBER, DATE or TIMESTAMP
--   (text ordering follows NLS_SORT/NLS_COMP, which this client never negotiates)

SELECT * FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS WHERE DEPARTMENT_NAME = '';
-- a comparison against an empty string, which Oracle treats as NULL

SELECT D FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_TYPES WHERE D = TIMESTAMP '2024-03-01 00:00:00.5';
-- a sub-second constant compared against a DATE column, which stores whole seconds
```

Note that `= 'SALES'` **is** pushed while `> 'A'` is not: equality does not
depend on collation, ordering does.

### 13.7 Write, with real transactions

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO ora.QUACK_DEMO_LOG (LABEL, AMOUNT) VALUES ('first', 10.50);
SELECT LOG_ID, LABEL, AMOUNT FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_LOG;   -- sees its own uncommitted row
ROLLBACK;
SELECT count(*) FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_LOG;                -- 0: Oracle rolled back too
```

Columns you do not name are left out of the statement, so Oracle's `IDENTITY`
and `DEFAULT` still apply, and `RETURNING` asks Oracle what it actually stored:

```sql
INSERT INTO ora.QUACK_DEMO_LOG (LABEL) VALUES ('with-defaults')
RETURNING LOG_ID, LABEL, LOGGED_AT;
```
```
┌────────┬───────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ LOG_ID │     LABEL     │      LOGGED_AT      │
│ 2      │ with-defaults │ 2026-08-22 09:40:53 │
└────────┴───────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

`UPDATE` and `DELETE` find rows by Oracle's ROWID, so the table needs no primary
key:

```sql
UPDATE ora.QUACK_DEMO_LOG SET AMOUNT = 99.99 WHERE LABEL = 'with-defaults';
DELETE FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_LOG WHERE LABEL = 'with-defaults';
```

Outside a transaction you can also send one statement, or a whole batch as
Oracle array DML — one parse, one round trip:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_execute_many('demo',
    'INSERT INTO QUACK_DEMO_LOG (LABEL, AMOUNT) VALUES (:label, :amount)',
    [{'label': 'a', 'amount': 1.5}, {'label': 'b', 'amount': 2.5}]);
-- affected_rows = 2

SELECT * FROM oracle_execute('demo',
    'DELETE FROM QUACK_DEMO_LOG WHERE LABEL IN (:1, :2)', ['a', 'b']);
-- affected_rows = 2
```

### 13.8 Call the procedures

Ask what the arguments are first — the answer comes from `ALL_ARGUMENTS`,
resolving synonyms:

```sql
SELECT position, argument_name, direction, oracle_type
FROM oracle_arguments('demo', 'QUACK_DEMO_GREET');
```
```
┌──────────┬───────────────┬───────────┬─────────────┐
│        1 │ P_NAME        │ in        │ VARCHAR2    │
│        2 │ P_GREETING    │ out       │ VARCHAR2    │
└──────────┴───────────────┴───────────┴─────────────┘
```

Then supply one text value per argument, in declaration order, `NULL` for each
`OUT` slot:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_call_auto('demo', 'QUACK_DEMO_ADD',   ['2', '3']);
-- return_value = 5
SELECT * FROM oracle_call_auto('demo', 'QUACK_DEMO_GREET', ['world', NULL]);
-- P_GREETING = hello, world
```

A `SYS_REFCURSOR` comes back as a handle you read once:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oracle_call_auto('demo', 'QUACK_DEMO_LIST', [NULL]);
-- P_ROWS  NULL  oracle:1:1
SELECT * FROM oracle_cursor('oracle:1:1');
```
```
┌───────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ DEPARTMENT_ID │ DEPARTMENT_NAME │
├───────────────┼─────────────────┤
│            10 │ ACCOUNTING      │
│            20 │ RESEARCH        │
│            30 │ SALES           │
│            40 │ OPERATIONS      │
└───────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### 13.9 Read one table through several sessions

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM oracle_scan_parallel('demo',
    'QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS', 'DEPARTMENT_ID', shards := 4);
```

Four rows through four sessions is pointless in itself — the point is that every
shard reads `AS OF SCN` at one change number taken before any of them start, so
the result is one snapshot. Against a real table, compare it with
`SELECT count(*) FROM ora.QUACK_DEMO_DEPARTMENTS`: the numbers must agree.

This needs `EXECUTE` on `SYS.DBMS_FLASHBACK` and `FLASHBACK` on the table. If
the database will not give out a change number, the scan is refused rather than
run unpinned.

### 13.10 Clean up

```sh
docker exec -i oracle-demo bash -c \
    'sqlplus -s system/$ORACLE_PASSWORD@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1' < examples/demo_teardown.sql
```

Or, in DuckDB, just `DETACH ora; DROP SECRET demo;` and stop the container.
